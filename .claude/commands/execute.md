# execute.md

## Position in the framework

Step 2 of 5 in the `/implement` workflow, invoked by `commands/implement.md`
(and, per-story, by `commands/implement-batch.md`).

- **Previous step**: `commands/plan.md`. Its output is the confirmed plan
  (which specialist agents, in what order) held in conversation context.
- **This step**: run each planned specialist agent in sequence against the
  actual product repo, collecting their change reports.
- **Next step**: `commands/test.md`, which receives the combined change
  reports from this step to determine what needs testing.

## What this command does

1. For each specialist agent in the plan, in order:
   - Spawn/invoke the agent (`agents/frontend.md`, `agents/backend.md`, or
     `agents/infrastructure.md`) with: the story file, the relevant slice
     of `architecture.md`, and the output/report of any prior agent in this
     sequence it depends on (e.g. the API contract a `backend` agent just
     produced).
   - The agent reads `rules/coding-style.md` and `rules/security.md` before
     writing anything, per its own definition.
   - The agent implements its part directly in the product repo (not in
     `knowledge/`), on the already-checked-out `feature/<feature-folder>`
     branch.
   - Collect its report: files changed, summary, any deviation from
     architecture, any new dependency, anything incomplete and why.
   - **Verify the report against disk before trusting it**, per
     `CLAUDE.md`'s "Agent completion verification" rule: run `git diff`/
     `git status` (and open the specific files the agent claims to have
     changed) and confirm the claimed changes are actually there. Do this
     even when the agent reports success, and even when it reports
     failure or returns nothing — a restarted/interrupted agent process
     can leave real, undisclosed work on disk, and a self-reported
     success is not itself evidence.
   - **Before moving to the next agent in the sequence**, the orchestrator
     verifies this agent's output against the contract it was handed (per
     `agents/orchestrator.md`'s execute responsibilities) — e.g. does the
     frontend agent's API usage actually match the backend agent's
     documented request/response shape? This is a quick consistency check,
     not a full review.
   - If the check fails, do not proceed to the next agent. Send the
     mismatch back to whichever agent drifted from the contract, with the
     specific discrepancy, and re-verify before continuing.
2. If an agent reports it's blocked on something the next agent in sequence
   was supposed to produce, stop and surface this to the user — don't let
   agents guess at each other's contracts.
3. **Write back architecture deviations.** If any agent's verified work
   deviated from `architecture.md` (and the deviation was accepted rather
   than sent back), append a dated `## Deviations` entry to that feature's
   `architecture.md` stating what changed and why. Later stories — and the
   next feature's `analyze.md` — plan against this document; letting it go
   stale silently is how story 5 gets built on story 1's abandoned
   decisions.
4. Once all planned agents have reported and passed their handoff checks,
   assemble a combined change report (all files touched across all agents,
   in order).

## Output

- Actual code changes committed to the working tree (not yet git-committed
  — that only happens in `commit.md` after tests pass).
- A combined change report, held in conversation context, passed directly
  into `test.md`.
